---
- **Simple** - can't be divided further e.g. roll no
- **Composite** - can be divided further e.g. full_name
---
- **Single Valued** - can only have one value e.g. roll no, as no student can have two or more roll no
- **Multi Valued** - can have two or more values e.g. phone_no, as people can have more than one phone no
---
- **Stored** - value stored / hard coded in database e.g. roll no
- **Dervied** - value determined at runtime e.g. age, as it is dervied from date of birth

Above three catagories are not disjoint means attributes can belong to one or more catagories e.g. roll no is simple, single and stored attribute.
